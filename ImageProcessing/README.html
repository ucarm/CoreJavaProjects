<h2>Image processing</h2>
</a>
<p>In this project, you will implement code to process digital images. A <em>digital image</em> is a rectangular grid of <em>pixels</em> (picture elements), where the color of each pixel is individually defined.   In this project, we work with  the types of images  are referred to as <em>vector</em> images.

<p> We provided a data type called Picture. The Picture data type allows you to manipulate digital images. You can load an image file using </p>
<p>Picture pic = new Picture(fileName);</p>
<p>Once loaded, you can manuplate the image using. For example: set the value of a pixel to a given color, and extract the color of a given pixel. The following API summarizes the available operations: </p>

<p>Most image-processing programs are filters that scan through all of the pixels in a source image and then perform some computation to determine the color of each pixel in a target image. In this project, you will implement code to flip (mirror) an image. For example:</p>
<p>Original Image:</p>
<p><img src="images/cybertek.png" width="640" height="106" alt=""/></p>
<p>Mirror image:</p>
<p><img src="images/cybertek-mirror.png" width="640" height="106" alt=""/></p>
